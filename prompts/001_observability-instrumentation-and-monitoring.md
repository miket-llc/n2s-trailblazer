# Shared Guardrails

PREAMBLE — Shared Guardrails (paste at the top of every prompt)
Save once as prompts/000_shared_guardrails.md and also paste at the top when
you run this prompt.

**Trailblazer Prompt Guardrails (read first)**

**Main only.** Do all work on main. No feature branches/PRs for routine work.

**Zero IDE linter errors across all file types.** If an IDE warns and our tools don't, update tool configs so the warning disappears permanently (don't hand-tweak files ad-hoc).

**Automate fixes first.** Always use the toolchain; never hand-fix format/lint.

```bash
make setup     # venv + dev deps + pre-commit
make fmt       # ruff --fix, black, mdformat for .md
make lint      # ruff check, mypy, markdownlint
make test      # pytest -q
```

**Markdown hygiene:** all .md must pass mdformat and markdownlint (e.g., fixes MD032 blanks-around-lists via formatter).

**Secrets hygiene:** placeholders only in repo/prompts; real values only in .env/CI. Secret scanning (e.g., gitleaks) is required in pre-commit.

**Pre-push gate:** tests must pass before pushing to main. Add/keep a pre-push pytest hook.

**Prompt size rule:** keep checklists to ≤9 to-dos (Cursor limit). Split into 004A/004B, etc., when needed.

**Proof-of-work:** in every prompt response, paste the exact commands run and the last ~10 lines of output for make fmt, make lint, and make test.

**Non-regression:** Never relax guardrails or remove stricter lint rules without explicit approval. Future prompts must start by pasting this file unchanged.

Confluence: Cloud v2 + Basic auth. Use v1 CQL only to prefilter when --since is set. Bodies/attachments fetched via v2.

Artifacts immutable: write to var/runs/run-id/phase/…; never mutate previous runs.

## Console UX Policy

Default to pretty, human-readable progress when attached to a TTY; default to JSON only in CI or when stdout is redirected.

Never intermix pretty output and JSON on the same stream. JSON → stdout; pretty/status/progress → stderr.

Always print the run_id at start/end of every command and write a final one-line summary.

Throttle progress updates; no more than 1 line per --progress-every N pages.

Keep the structured event names stable: confluence.space, confluence.page, confluence.attachments.

## Database Non-Negotiables (Global)

- Ingest is DB-free: importing or running any ingest CLI/step MUST NOT connect to, import, or initialize the DB.
- Postgres-first for runtime: Any command that persists or queries embeddings (e.g., `embed load`, `ask`, future retrieval services) MUST require Postgres + pgvector in non-test environments. SQLite is allowed ONLY for unit tests/CI and must be explicitly opted-in.
- Single source of truth: DB_URL MUST be provided in `.env` and used by a single engine factory. No hardcoded defaults that silently fall back to SQLite in dev/prod.
- Preflight required: `trailblazer db check` MUST pass (connectivity + pgvector present) before `embed load` or `ask` run (unless tests explicitly opt-in to SQLite).
- Secrets hygiene: Never print DB credentials in logs; log the host/database name only.

## DB policy

PostgreSQL + pgvector is the required default for any embed/retrieve/ask.

SQLite is tests-only (unit/integration) and must be explicit in tests.

Ingest/normalize must not require a DB.

No silent fallback to SQLite in runtime code paths. Fail fast with an actionable message if Postgres isn't configured.

Provide a single place to diagnose: trailblazer db doctor.

## Additional Global Rules

**Tests:** No merges to main with any failing tests. If tests fail, fix tests or the code; do not comment out or delete tests unless replaced by better coverage in the same PR.

**DB policy:** Ingest & normalize must not require a DB. Postgres/pgvector is only for retrieval/indexing phases; CLI preflights for DB must not gate ingest/normalize.

**Body format:** Confluence default body_format is atlas_doc_format (ADF). Storage/XHTML handling stays for backward compatibility and normalization.

**Traceability:** Always persist id, url, space_id/key/name (if available), version, created_at, updated_at, labels, ancestors/breadcrumbs, attachments (with filenames + download URLs), links, and content_sha256 throughout ingest → normalize.

**Observability:** All long-running CLIs must stream clean, structured progress (banners, per-phase counters, ETA) and print the run_id at completion.

**Cursor limit:** Keep prompts ≤10 to-dos; chunk work if needed.

**No regression:** Before edits, read the module and associated tests; prefer minimal deltas. If complexity is high, refactor in tiny steps with passing tests after each step.

# PROMPT FOR CLAUDE — Observability: Instrumentation, Live Status, ETA, Assurance, and Quality Gates (Bespoke N2S)

Execute now. Do not draft a plan. Paste the guardrails verbatim first, then perform each numbered step and paste proofs (commands + outputs).
No assumptions: discover schemas/flags/paths from the repo (rg/grep) and DB (psql) and use those values.

000 — Paste guardrails (verbatim, unchanged)

Open prompts/000_shared_guardrails.md.

Paste its full contents at the very top of your reply, unchanged. (Mandatory.)

📁 Prompts directory conventions (enforce before work)

Name: prompts/NNN_slug.md (three‑digit NNN).

Split: use A/B suffixes only if necessary.

Index: maintain prompts/README.md sorted ascending.

Non‑conforming prompts: delete (preferred) or archive under var/archive/prompts/<ts>/.

🤖 Model

Use Claude for this prompt. If you switch models for a subtask, state:
Switch: <model> — Reason: <why> and continue.

✅ To‑Do Checklist (≤9)

1. Save this prompt properly (numbered) and commit
1. Pre‑flight (Postgres‑only, no pagers, kill stale, discover CLI)
1. Define & enforce event schemas (ground‑truthed) + stream rules
1. Heartbeats, EPS, worker‑aware ETA, and status files
1. Assurance & quality gates (prove "right content, right format, not lost")
1. Monitor CLI (TUI + JSON) — live visibility without IDE
1. Data integrity & format validation (prevent loss, enforce structure)
1. Live demo: run a short job and show readable status, ETA, and quality artifacts
1. Proof‑of‑work & commit
