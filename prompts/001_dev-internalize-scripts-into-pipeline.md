# Shared Guardrails

PREAMBLE ‚Äî Shared Guardrails (paste at the top of every prompt)
Save once as prompts/000_shared_guardrails.md and also paste at the top when
you run this prompt.

**Trailblazer Prompt Guardrails (read first)**

**Main only.** Do all work on main. No feature branches/PRs for routine work.

**Zero IDE linter errors across all file types.** If an IDE warns and our tools don't, update tool configs so the warning disappears permanently (don't hand-tweak files ad-hoc).

**Automate fixes first.** Always use the toolchain; never hand-fix format/lint.

```bash
make setup     # venv + dev deps + pre-commit
make fmt       # ruff --fix, black, mdformat for .md
make lint      # ruff check, mypy, markdownlint
make test      # pytest -q
```

**Markdown hygiene:** all .md must pass mdformat and markdownlint (e.g., fixes MD032 blanks-around-lists via formatter).

**Secrets hygiene:** placeholders only in repo/prompts; real values only in .env/CI. Secret scanning (e.g., gitleaks) is required in pre-commit.

**Pre-push gate:** tests must pass before pushing to main. Add/keep a pre-push pytest hook.

**Prompt size rule:** keep checklists to ‚â§9 to-dos (Cursor limit). Split into 004A/004B, etc., when needed.

**Proof-of-work:** in every prompt response, paste the exact commands run and the last ~10 lines of output for make fmt, make lint, and make test.

**Non-regression:** Never relax guardrails or remove stricter lint rules without explicit approval. Future prompts must start by pasting this file unchanged.

Confluence: Cloud v2 + Basic auth. Use v1 CQL only to prefilter when --since is set. Bodies/attachments fetched via v2.

Artifacts immutable: write to var/runs/run-id/phase/‚Ä¶; never mutate previous runs.

## Console UX Policy

Default to pretty, human-readable progress when attached to a TTY; default to JSON only in CI or when stdout is redirected.

Never intermix pretty output and JSON on the same stream. JSON ‚Üí stdout; pretty/status/progress ‚Üí stderr.

Always print the run_id at start/end of every command and write a final one-line summary.

Throttle progress updates; no more than 1 line per --progress-every N pages.

Keep the structured event names stable: confluence.space, confluence.page, confluence.attachments.

## Database Non-Negotiables (Global)

- Ingest is DB-free: importing or running any ingest CLI/step MUST NOT connect to, import, or initialize the DB.
- Postgres-first for runtime: Any command that persists or queries embeddings (e.g., `embed load`, `ask`, future retrieval services) MUST require Postgres + pgvector in non-test environments. SQLite is allowed ONLY for unit tests/CI and must be explicitly opted-in.
- Single source of truth: DB_URL MUST be provided in `.env` and used by a single engine factory. No hardcoded defaults that silently fall back to SQLite in dev/prod.
- Preflight required: `trailblazer db check` MUST pass (connectivity + pgvector present) before `embed load` or `ask` run (unless tests explicitly opt-in to SQLite).
- Secrets hygiene: Never print DB credentials in logs; log the host/database name only.

## DB policy

PostgreSQL + pgvector is the required default for any embed/retrieve/ask.

SQLite is tests-only (unit/integration) and must be explicit in tests.

Ingest/normalize must not require a DB.

No silent fallback to SQLite in runtime code paths. Fail fast with an actionable message if Postgres isn't configured.

Provide a single place to diagnose: trailblazer db doctor.

## Additional Global Rules

**Tests:** No merges to main with any failing tests. If tests fail, fix tests or the code; do not comment out or delete tests unless replaced by better coverage in the same PR.

**DB policy:** Ingest & normalize must not require a DB. Postgres/pgvector is only for retrieval/indexing phases; CLI preflights for DB must not gate ingest/normalize.

**Body format:** Confluence default body_format is atlas_doc_format (ADF). Storage/XHTML handling stays for backward compatibility and normalization.

**Traceability:** Always persist id, url, space_id/key/name (if available), version, created_at, updated_at, labels, ancestors/breadcrumbs, attachments (with filenames + download URLs), links, and content_sha256 throughout ingest ‚Üí normalize.

**Observability:** All long-running CLIs must stream clean, structured progress (banners, per-phase counters, ETA) and print the run_id at completion.

**Cursor limit:** Keep prompts ‚â§10 to-dos; chunk work if needed.

**No regression:** Before edits, read the module and associated tests; prefer minimal deltas. If complexity is high, refactor in tiny steps with passing tests after each step.

## Non-Negotiable: Observability & Assurance

**Rich Console Progress:** All ingest commands MUST provide Rich-formatted progress with overall/per-space bars, heartbeats every 30s, and colored status indicators. Use `--no-color` to disable.

**Structured Event Logging:** Every ingest run MUST emit structured NDJSON events to `var/logs/<run_id>.ndjson` including: space.begin/end, page.fetch/write, attachment.fetch/write, heartbeat, warning, error with full traceability keys (source, space_key, space_id, page_id, title, version, url, attachment_id, sha256, bytes).

**Assurance Reports:** Every ingest MUST generate `assurance.json` and `assurance.md` with totals, per-space stats, zero-body pages, non-ADF bodies, missing/failed attachments, top 10 largest items, retry stats, error summaries, and reproduction command.

**Attachment Verification:** For every page with attachments, verify count written == count reported; retry with exponential backoff on mismatch; surface red counter in progress panel.

**Resumability Evidence:** When using `--since` or `--auto-since`, display what will happen: pages_known, estimated_to_fetch, skipped_unchanged counts with reasons (updated, deleted, moved).

**Zero Test Failures:** All observability features MUST have offline smoke tests that verify progress/heartbeat output, NDJSON event structure, and assurance report generation without network calls.

**No DB in Ingest:** Event logging and assurance generation MUST NOT require database connectivity - all observability is file-based under var/.

# PROMPT FOR CLAUDE ‚Äî Dev Refactor: Internalize Scripts into Trailblazer Pipeline (Bespoke N2S, No SQLite, Ground‚ÄëTruthed by Code/DB Introspection)

Execute now. Don't "draft a plan." Paste the guardrails verbatim first, then perform each numbered step and paste proofs (commands + outputs).
Absolutely no assumptions: for anything schema/flag/path related, discover from the repo and DB (ripgrep + psql) and use those exact values.

000 ‚Äî Paste guardrails (verbatim, unchanged)

Open prompts/000_shared_guardrails.md.

Paste its full contents at the very top of your reply, unchanged. (Mandatory.)

üìÅ Prompts directory conventions (enforce before coding)

Name: prompts/NNN_slug.md (three‚Äëdigit number).

Split: use A/B suffixes only if you must split.

Index: maintain prompts/README.md sorted ascending.

Non‚Äëconforming prompts: delete (preferred) or move to var/archive/prompts/<ts>/.

This pipeline is bespoke for Navigate‚Äëto‚ÄëSaaS. Do not generalize; do not add multi‚Äëtenant abstractions.

‚úÖ To‚ÄëDo Checklist (‚â§9 items)

1. Save this prompt correctly (then commit)
1. Pre‚Äëflight: env, Postgres‚Äëonly, kill stale procs (no secrets in logs)
1. Ground‚Äëtruth the CLI surface from the repo (no guessing)
1. Inventory every script and map it to the proper CLI command
1. Ground‚Äëtruth the DB schema and vector columns directly from Postgres
1. Internalize each script into the CLI with observability & Postgres‚Äëonly runtime
1. Route Make/CI/docs to the CLI; enforce "no SQLite" again; update help
1. Smoke runs (CLI only, no scripts) ‚Äî use real flags you discovered
1. Proof‚Äëof‚Äëwork & Definition of Done (commit)
